# Code of Conduct

The Indexing Your Heart project strives to maintain a healthy community that focuses on creating quality content that represents the best the community has to offer. We want to have a healthy, productive community that is willing to take risks and foster relationships with others in an effort to create an inclusive environment that embodies the premise of Indexing Your Heart.

This Code of Conduct describes and governs how the community should act in both the public and private spheres, whenever the project’s reputation is at stake.

    This code of conduct is loosely based off of the Ubuntu Code of Conduct from the Ubuntu Project. You can view the code of conduct at [https://ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct).
    
    Likewise, some inspiration comes from The Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct, which you can access at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).
    
## Key tenets and goals

### Be respectful

Respect for others is a must have for the project and the community. Every community member is a human, and we must respect that, regardless of background. We will not tolerate hate speech or any form of disrespect that makes anyone in our community feel threatened or uncomfortable.

### Take responsibility for our actions

Every member in the Indexing Your Heart community is a human; naturally, we all make mistakes. When we take responsibility for our actions, we recognize this fact and allow ourselves to correct the wrong and strive to do better.

### Promote collaboration

Some of our best work happens when we collaborate with each other. Fostering an environment that allows for others to contribute ideas, challenge assumptions, and seek to improve the  project is critical to making Indexing Your Heart successful.

## Leadership

The Indexing Your Heart community will be governed by the “benevolent dictator”, who delegates community standards enforcement to the Project Council (PC). They will be responsible for overseeing the community and enforcing standards for behavior as defined in this Code of Conduct, in addition to being the best representatives of this Code of Conduct.

This leadership should not be taken lightly, as it is a *privilege* above all else; their power remains effective on the project insofar as the community willingly follows them.

## Enforcement guidelines

The following system will be the framework used to determine the consequences of an offender’s actions that a member of the PC or the “benevolent dictator” has determined violates this Code of Conduct, depending on the severity of the action. Examples are provided for each step in the system, but note that each system is not limited to those examples.

### 1. Written warning

**Examples**: Inappropriate language

A written warning will be issued to the offender upon the first time the Code of Conduct is violated, giving them the opportunity to correct their wrong. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Temporary ban

**Examples**: Repeated offenses where written warnings were issued

A temporary ban will be placed on the offender for seven consecutive days. They will not be able to communicate with the project or contribute to source code for a the period of time specified.

### 3. Permanent ban

**Examples**: Hate speech, threats, severe damage to the project, or continuous repeat offenses

A permanent ban will be placed on the offender, and the project will sever all ties with the offender. They will not be able to participate in the project.
