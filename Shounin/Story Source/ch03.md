Ah, Friday… it’s finally here; it feels like I’ve been waiting forever. Maybe it’s because I’m excited to see Sam again, but it could’ve also been a lot of other things. I guess it’s just been a long week. 

Well, no matter. As I sit in front of Le Papillon Pâtisserie and wait for Sam, I pull out the book I checked out from the library from my purse and pick up where I left off. *After the Mirage*, it’s called; I’ve been waiting to read this addition to the series for months now. This one’s a page-turner, and I’m already halfway through the book.

Sam arrives and sits next to me just as I finish my current chapter.

Sam: “Hey there. Whatcha reading?”  
Chelsea: “Oh, just this new murder mystery book.”  
Chelsea: “The library received it on Thursday and reserved it for me.”

I close the book and hand it to Sam. Sam inspects the cover, flipping it around occasionally.

Sam: “Huh. Never heard of this one. Looks like you’re halfway through this one, too.”  
Chelsea: “Oh, this one’s a page-turner, that’s for sure!”

Sam hands me the book, and I stash it into my purse.

Sam: “So, did you have anything in mind?”  
Chelsea: “How about we head to Kellihim Park? There’s a spot I really like to sit at.”  
Sam: “Sure, why not.”

The two of us get up from the bench and start walking down the road until we reach Narock Boulevard. As we continue walking down Narock Boulevard, I look around and spot the dealership across the street.

Chelsea: "How long has that dealership been there?"  
Sam: "For as long as I can remember. Why do you ask?"  
Chelsea: "I don't think I've ever noticed it, really."  
Sam: "You seemed to know where it was two weeks ago."

- "You think they capitalize on extended car warranties?"
    - Sam: "Right, the only business to get into nowadays..."
    - I snicker as Sam smirks.
    - Chelsea: “Come on, you have to admit that was a good one.”
    - Sam: “Yeah, I suppose.”
- "I guess they sell cars?"
    - Sam: "Well, aren't you Captain Obvious?"
    - Sam shoves me and laughs a little.
    - Chelsea: “Sometimes you have to point out the obvious.”

Sam follows me to the spot in Kellihim Park where I wanted to take them. A bunch of trees surround the spot, allowing the sunlight to peek through the leaves. The lush, green grass takes in the sunlight and glows a little. I sit down next to a tree and pat to an open spot next to me. Sam follows and takes a seat next to me, leaning against the tree.

Sam: "Wow. How often do you come here?"  
Chelsea: "Eh, about once a month. Maybe every two weeks."  
Chelsea: "It just kind of depends on the occasion."  
Sam: "Well, you certainly have a knack for finding these sorts of places."  
Chelsea: "I guess I know where to look when I need some inspiration."  

I take off my shoes and set them aside. Grabbing the zipper at the bottom of my dress, I zip up the circumference and readjust my body.

Sam: “Hold up. Your dress can turn into a little cocoon?”  
Chelsea: “I meant to wear this one when I first met you, but I needed to fix the seams around the sleeves.”  
Chelsea: “I finally got around to it on Wednesday after ordering some new threading.”  
Sam: “Oh. That’s, uh, interesting…”  
Chelsea: “I mean, have you ever seen a hammer with shoes and arms?”  
Sam: “Not until a couple of weeks ago. But you still have the arms here.”  
Chelsea: “Well, of course. Kinda need that to do stuff, right?”  
Sam: “Yeah, I suppose.”

I slide my legs down and cross them to get a bit more comfortable.

Chelsea: “You know, I’m kind of surprised that you’d ask about the stub, but not even bat an eye at my ability to read with the mask on.”  
Sam: “I mean, you’re able to see me under that mask, so I just assumed you have really good eyesight.”  
Chelsea: “Fair enough.”

I lean against Sam on the tree.

Chelsea: “I can unzip my stub and let my paws stick out, if that’s more comfortable for you.”  
Sam: “Nah, it’s fine. I was just merely curious.”  
Sam: "Normally, if someone in a costume like that decides to lean up against me, I would be weirded out."
Sam: "But you're an exception to the rule."
Chelsea: "Aww, I get special exemptions! How sweet of you."

The two of us laugh wholeheartedly.

Sam: “I don’t suppose you have a blanket in your purse, do you?”  
Sam: “The grass is starting to get a bit itchy.”  
Chelsea: “I do, actually. Hold on.”

I put my purse in my lap and pull out my Hexcode blanket, and Sam gasps lightly.

Sam: “First off, how in the world did you fit that into your purse?”  
Chelsea: “Oh, it’s a lot deeper than it looks. It’s no magic carpet bag, though.”  
Chelsea: “I still haven’t figured that out. Mary Poppins has the upper hand, there.”  
Sam: “Right… and the other thing…”  
Chelsea: “Hmm? What is it?”

We get up for a brief moment so I can shake the blanket and place it neatly on the grass.

Sam: “Is that the background for the Hexcode logo?”  
Chelsea: “It sure is! I figured you’d notice.”  
Sam: “Did you order that online or…?”  
Chelsea: “Nope, made it myself. Katy gave me the visuals, and I just did the rest.”

Sam watches as I sit down on the blanket.

Sam: “Oh my God, I have to take a picture of this…”  
Chelsea: “Oh, okay! You want me to pose or anything?”  
Sam: “Nah, you’re in a perfect spot for this.”

Sam pulls out their phone, lines up the shot, and takes a picture.

Sam: “That’s awesome. Now I get the whole hammer thing.”  
Chelsea: “Really?”  
Sam: “I mean, the blanket makes it kind of obvious now.”

I giggle lightly. As Sam puts their phone away, I scoot over a little so Sam can sit down. They take a seat next to me and rest their hand on my shins.

Sam: “So, how come you wanted to make the costume for Hexcode?”  
Chelsea: “Well, it’s a bit of a dirty secret, but…”

I try to lean in as close as I can to Sam without disrupting them and start picking at my fingernails.

Chelsea: “I may be learning how to make apps for Lotus devices.”  
Sam: “No way! You’re serious?"  
Chelsea: “Well, my father liked to tinker with microcontrollers and electronics in his spare time when I was a pup.”  
Chelsea: “So I learned some programming during my school years. You know, basic assembly instructions and C.”  
Chelsea: “Of course, I knew my future had to have been in music, but it was a nice little hobby.”  
Sam: “Huh, that’s really interesting! Does anyone else know?”  
Chelsea: “Eh, not really.”  
Sam: “Not even Katy?”  
Chelsea: “Never asked about it. I kind of stopped after I released my first album, though.”  
Sam: “Oh, how come?”  
Chelsea: “Dude, Subjective-E is incredibly hard to learn. I have no idea how you write anything in it!”  
Chelsea: “It just looks like a word soup, if I’m honest…”

Sam laughs, lightly slapping my shin.

Sam: “Subjective-E is really old, Chelsea. That’s for legacy stuff.”  
Sam: “The mobile team at my company uses Lift to make Lotus apps. Much more friendly.”  
Sam: “Sorry that you had to subject yourself to the horror…”  
Chelsea: “Y-you’re kidding me, right? I, uh…”

*Why me? How do I manage to pick the wrong language to learn? God, that’s embarrassing…* I sigh and slouch a little. Sam swings around and hugs me.

Sam: “Don’t be so hard on yourself about it, Chelsea. They certainly don’t make it easy to figure out the first time around.”  
Sam: “But I still think it’s pretty cool that you know a little bit of what I do.”  
Sam: “And low-level stuff, too. Gotta give props there.”

I weakly giggle, trying to dismiss my embarrassment.

Chelsea: “Well, it’s been a while since I touched it. My computer’s just so old that even looking through my photos is a nightmare.”  
Sam: “Oh? How old is it?”  
Chelsea: “I got it in 2006.”  
Sam: “But, it still functions, right?”  
Chelsea: “Barely. Katry tried to fix it. Upgrade after upgrade, but the thing’s on its last legs.”  
Chelsea: “Even Papa says I should get a new one.”  
Sam: “Is there anything stopping you from doing so?”  
Chelsea: “Does me being old-school count?”

Sam chuckles.

Chelsea: “Like, seriously! I handwrite my lyrics and stuff.”  
Sam: “Oh, there’s nothing wrong with that. I know there’s a pedagogical benefit to it.”  
Chelsea: “Oh. Well, I guess I just never get around to it.”  
Sam: “That’s fair. Just keep going at your own pace.”

Sam grabs the bag they’ve been carrying around this whole time and brings it towards us.

Sam: “Now, how about we change the subject a little bit? I have something for you.”  
Chelsea: “Hmm? What’s that?”

Sam reaches into the bag and pulls out a box.

Sam: “I checked with Katy first to make sure you’re not gonna die from this.”  
Chelsea: “Uh,, okay…?”

They open the box up and reveal tiny chocolate squares. And the good kind, too; they must’ve went to Zimmerman’s Sweets… I gasp lightly. Most of my family would die from eating this, but somehow my father and I got exempt from the chocolate allergy.

Chelsea: “Aww, no way! May I?”  
Sam: “Please, do.”

Carefully, I pull off the helmet, set it aside, and reached into the box. I pull out a chocolate square and place it into my mouth. It melts instantaneously, letting the flavor get captured by my taste buds. *Dark chocolate: my favorite…*

Chelsea: “Mmm, so good…”

Sam cracks a smile and takes a square for themselves.

Chelsea: “Did you know that dark chocolate was my favorite?”  
Sam: “Yeah, Katy told me.”

I giggle lightly and reach into the box to grab another piece. To my surprise, Sam grabs a square and slides it into my mouth like a slot-loading CD drive. After letting that square melt in my mouth and swallowing, I smile and making whirring noises, as if I were reading a CD myself.

Sam cackles.

Sam: “What the hell is that?”  
Chelsea: “What? I’m reading a chocolate square CD, silly.”  
Sam: “You goofball…”  
Chelsea: “You have to admit the impression was good, though.”  
Chelsea: “I studied that sound from the vintage collection of Lotus computers I have at my place.”  
Sam: “You collect vintage Lotus computers? Huh, that’s interesting.”  
Chelsea: “Oh, of course! They had some wild colors back then. In fact…”

I get up and wriggle my way out of my hammer dress, revealing my outfit: a white blouse and leggings with that signature Bondi blue suit jacket and skirt.

Sam: “Oh, my God, that outfit is just… so adorable!”  
Chelsea: “Thanks! It took me a while to find the skirt and jacket with the right color.”  
Chelsea: “I must’ve looked like a weirdo with a palette in my hand, matching the colors…”  
Sam: “You think someone would notice?”  
Chelsea: “I suppose not.”

I sit back down, cross my legs, and lean against Sam again.

Chelsea: “I really wanted to have shoes that match, but it’s just so bloody difficult for me.”  
Sam: “Really? How come?”  
Chelsea: “How many brands do you know that make shoes with anthros like me in mind?”

Sam ponders for a while.

Sam: “Huh. I see your point.”  
Chelsea: “I mean, I’d like to have a pair of ‘neutral’ sneakers along with my teal kicks here and the Greek goddess-like sandals I have back home.”  
Chelsea: “But I just can’t find a pair that fits me, let alone ones that I like.”  
Sam: “Oh. Sorry to hear that…”  
Chelsea: “Eh, it is what it is. We’re always just an afterthought.”  
Chelsea: “I’m lucky these ones have lasted as long as they have.”  
Sam: “Well, you do look pretty cute wearing them…”

I lightly giggle. *They sure know how to flatter me, that’s  for sure.*

Chelsea: “I know this is a tad sudden and we’ve only dated once or twice, but…”  
Chelsea: “… can I cuddle with you?”  
Sam: “Cuddle? Sure.”

Sam barely picks me up and places me in their lap. I stretch my legs out and cross them, delicately balancing my paws on top of their legs. Sam wraps their arms around me.

Chelsea: “You make a good cuddle buddy, hehe…”

Sam smiles.

Sam: “I’ve been meaning to ask this, but how come you don’t have a tail?”  
Chelsea: “I don’t really know. My family doesn’t have tails, so I guess we somehow evolved without them.”  
Chelsea: “I guess mother nature said we’re fine without them. It makes finding clothes easier, that’s for sure…”  
Sam: “I bet.”

The two of us bask in the sunlight and watch the trees swaying back and forth. Everything felt nice, quiet, and calm. I smile and rest my eyes for a little. This is definitely gonna work, I can feel it…

Sam: “God, you’re cute…”
