It’s been about a week or two since the event. I feel a bit better now, but it’s been hard catching up after being torn down like that. I feel like I’m always behind, and I’m exhausted. I don’t want to do anything too extravagant today; I hope Sam can work with that.

> A knocking sound plays.

I stand in front of Sam’s door and knock, waiting patiently. Staring at my shoes, I sigh. I didn’t bother to put on an outfit that really matches the hammer head today, mostly because I’m just too tired to think of anything. I hope Sam doesn’t mind.

Sam opens the door and greets me.

Sam: “Hey. Didn’t realize you were coming here to meet me.”  
Chelsea: “I would’ve called and all, but I’m… exhausted.”  
Sam: “Oh. Are you alright?”  
Chelsea: “Yeah, I’m fine.”  
Sam: “Come in, please.”

Sam gestures and I step inside. I notice some spray cleaner on the counter as Sam closes the door behind me.

Chelsea: “Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t realize you were cleaning…”  
Sam: “You’re fine. I was just about done, anyway.”

Sam puts the spray cleaner below the kitchen sink.

Sam: “So, I’m guessing the past couple of weeks since I last saw you did a number, eh?”  
Chelsea: “… yeah. It’s been a bit rough.”  
Chelsea: “I always feel like I’m playing catch-up. No amount of dream therapy is gonna help fix that.”  
Sam: “… dream therapy?”  
Chelsea: “Long story.”

The two of us take a seat on the couch. I take off my shoes and bring my legs up onto the couch.

Sam: “So, what’s up with this ‘dream therapy’ thing?”  
Chelsea: “Oh, it’s just that one game I’ve been playing a while.”  
Sam: “Oh, I see…”  
Sam: “So, uh, is there anything you’d like to do?”

I scoot towards Sam and lean on their side.

Chelsea: “Not really…”  
Sam: “How about a chill day, then? We can order some pizza and do something here.”  
Chelsea: “A chill day… I’d like that.”

Part of me wants to take off the helmet, but I feel really lazy right now. *Oh well*. As I readjust myself to cuddle with Sam, they pull me closer and rub my arm.

Sam: “Wow, you must be really exhausted if you took your helmet off…”  
Chelsea: “I… didn’t really even bother with matching my outfit today.”  
Sam: “I’m not so sure. At least you look comfortable in those black sweatpants.”

I quietly giggle.

Sam: “You look like you need a nap. You want me to grab some pillows, or…?”  
Chelsea: “… a nap…”

Just the thought of a nap already puts me out of it.

Sam: “Yeah, you really do need one. Let me grab some pillows.”

I adjust myself as Sam gets up from the couch to grab pillows. Man, I’m having a hard time keeping my eyes open… Before I know it, my head falls onto a pillow, and I’m sprawled out on the couch. I can hear Sam giggle for a moment.

Sam: “Yeah, you desperately need it. You stay here and rest.”  
Sam: “I’m gonna order some pizza and read in the chair over here.”  
Sam: “Oh, and let me get this over you.”

Sam pulls a blanket that draped over the back of the couch and slides it over me. *God, it feels so soft and fuzzy…*

Chelsea: “… nap time…”

Sam bends over to my head and kisses my helmet where my cheek would be. And, just like that, I’ve drifted to sleep…

---

Sam: “Hey, Chelsea…”

*Ugh, what happened…?* My eyes open slowly, though I can barely see anything. Oh, right; I forgot I had the helmet on. But I can still see Sam in front of me.

Chelsea: “How long have I been asleep for?”  
Sam: “About half an hour.”  
Chelsea: “Oh…”  
Sam: “Don’t worry too much about it. I could tell you really needed it.”  
Sam: “The pizza’s here. You want a slice of the cheese or the pepperoni one?”  
Sam: “I wasn’t sure which one you liked, so I grabbed both just in case.”

I slowly get up from the couch and stretch.

Chelsea: “Pepperoni sounds good, thanks.”  
Sam: “Sure thing, I’ll get you a plate.”

While Sam goes to the counter, I pull off the helmet and set it aside on the couch. I rub my eyes, hoping I could wake up a bit more. Despite the struggle, I feel well rested; I haven’t felt that in a while.

Sam brings me a plate with a slice of pie on it and sets a small ceramic cup on the table.

Chelsea: “Thanks…”  
Sam: “I don’t have soda or anything like that, but I made some tea.”  
Chelsea: “Tea?”  
Sam: “Yeah. Passionfruit.”

Sam takes a seat next to me and lets me rest on their shoulder. I take a bite from the slice and hold the plate in place, catching any grease that might have fallen. I hear Sam giggle lightly.

Chelsea: “Hmm?”  
Sam: “Sorry, uh… it’s just…”  
Chelsea: “What is it?”  
Sam: “You look really cute eating. Sorry, it’s weird, but…”  
Chelsea: “Oh, no, you’re fine.”

I take a few more bites and sip on my tea.

Chelsea: “Ooh…”

*That’s really nice…* My stomach feels nice and warm.

Sam: “That’s a relief. I wasn’t sure if you’d like that particular flavor.”

Sam takes a few more bites. *They’re trying really hard to not crack a smile while doing it, I can tell…* I giggle and take another bite from my slice.

Sam: “You’re really cute, you know that?”

I’m still chewing, so I smile and giggle in lieu of a verbal response. I *want to hold these warm and fuzzy feelings for as long as I can…*

Sam: “Hey…”

I adjust myself and look into Sam’s eyes. Sam turns their head down and kisses the top of my muzzle.

Sam: “I love you.”  
Chelsea: “Aww, I love you, too…”

I rub the side of my face against their chest. *This is it; they did the thing…* I couldn’t possibly feel any better than I am right now. We’re a couple now, that’s for sure.

Sam and I spend some more time eating the pizza and enjoying each other’s company as the time passes. This is exactly what I needed. Not bad for just a ‘chill day’…

We finish eating and clean up a little before returning to the couch. I cuddle up next to them again, though they push me directly onto their lap instead.

Sam: “So, it’s the beginning of September. Don’t you have a birthday coming up soon?”  
Chelsea: “Yeah… it’s in a couple of weeks.”  
Sam: “Are you planning everything or just laying low?”  
Chelsea: “Well, uh… I haven’t really though about it…”  
Sam: “Oh, okay. If you want, I could make a nice dinner for you.”  
Sam: “Nothing too fancy or anything. Just the two of us here.”  
Chelsea: “Thanks…”

I’m glad they understand and aren’t pushing too hard for anything. Even Katorin and some of my other friends get a little antsy.

Sam: “So, is there anything you’d like to do now?”  
Chelsea: “You know, there’s this one game I’ve been meaning to play, but…”  
Chelsea: “It, uh, requires two people to play it.”  
Sam: “Sure, I don’t mind.”  
Chelsea: “Thanks.”

I pull out my little console and flip up the kickstand. While the game starts, I hand Sam one of the mini controllers and lay on the couch, crossing my legs.

Chelsea: “You make a really good pillow substitute.”  
Sam: “Oh, do I?”  
Sam: “Say, you want me to put the blanket over you again?”

I grab the blanket and throw it over myself, ignoring the fact that my paws weren’t covered.

Sam: “Aren’t your paws gonna get cold?”  
Chelsea: “It’s fine, really. My toes are still warm.”  
Sam: “Did you decide to paint your nails?”  
Chelsea: “I’ve just put a clear coat on. Found some clear polish in the back of the cabinet.”  
Sam: “Ah.”

The game starts right away, skipping the menu entirely. Just like that, our little characters are running around the screen as we mess around with the controllers.

Chelsea: “Huh, there’s no menu. I wasn’t expecting that.”  
Sam: “Me either.”

We spend the next couple of hours playing the game. It was both parts enlightening and challenging. I’ve played instruction-less puzzle games like this before, but never in a cooperative capacity. I had a lot of fun with it, though I’m not sure if Sam feels the same way.

Sam: “Well, congrats, you broke my brain somehow.”  
Chelsea: “Haha, it’s okay…”

I prop myself up on the couch and lean against Sam again.

Sam: “Hey, at least I enjoyed it.”

Sam boops my muzzle as I giggle. For a brief moment, we lock on to each other’s eyes, drowning everything else out. And, before we know it… We kissed. And not just a small peck or anything, but a full, wholehearted kiss. My first one, at that. And, was it delightful…

Sam: “Well, uh, that was quite the…”

We both giggle and go at it again, this time for longer. I’ve never felt this intimately close with anyone. It’s a strangely satisfying feeling. A few minutes pass before we wean off and lay together on the couch.

Sam: “You know, I’ve had my fair share of puppy kisses before, but…”  
Sam: “Never like that. You seem like an expert at this.”  
Chelsea: “I, uhh… that was my first one, hehe…”  
Sam: “Honestly, same. Never could get close like that.”

I smile and hug Sam.

Chelsea: “This couch is too bloody comfortable. Now I don’t want to get up.”  
Sam: “You could stay the night, if you want.”  
Chelsea: “You’d let me?”  
Sam: “I don’t mind.”  
Chelsea: “Thanks. I appreciate it...”

I cuddle next to them and smile.

Sam: “You’re definitely doing a good job at radiating off that happy energy of yours.”  
Chelsea: “Hmm? What makes you say that?”  
Sam: “I can feel you wiggling your toes.”

The two of us look at each other before bursting into laughter and giving each other a quick smooch. *God, I love them so much…*
