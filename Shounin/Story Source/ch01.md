Tonight can’t be more perfect; it’s a Friday night, *Antony’s Tavern* seems pretty full, and I’m about to perform again. I used to perform here while I started working on my first album, though I don’t do it as much now. It’s good to get back in the groove, especially after the tavern being closed for as long as it did.

It’s a special night, too. My best friend, Katorin, promised to introduce me to her colleague. They finished some big project this morning and want to celebrate. She never really talks to me about her job, though I bet it’s some programming deal. I’m excited to finally meet someone she works with!

The opening band finishes their last number, waves goodbye, and walks down the steps. I didn’t really listen in, as I spaced out a little. One of the members approaches me.

Band Member: “I’m surprised you weren’t over by that mirror.”  
Chelsea: “Should I have been?”  
Band Member: “Most of them do. You seem the confident type, though.”  
Chelsea: “Uhh, thanks?”

They pat my shoulder and walk off, regrouping with their band mates. I don’t understand people, sometimes.

"Everybody Wants to Rule the World" plays on a loudspeaker. The whine from the loudspeaker seems a bit more amplified, despite it being usually unnoticeable. I just hope it doesn’t give me a headache.

I peek over to the side and look through the crowd. Instantly, I spot Katorin with her supposed colleague at a table towards the back. Her sparkling violet and pink hair, along with her energetic and passionate personality, are pretty hard to miss. The former Catalina City resident seems deep in conversation with her colleague. At least she kept her promise!

It isn’t long before I’m given the OK to get up on stage. This shouldn’t be too bad, I’ve done this before. Before I get up on stage, I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn around and see Ben and Jordan, two friends of mine.

Chelsea: “Oh, hey! I haven’t seen you in a while.”  
Jordan: “You surprised us when I heard that you were performing tonight.”  
Ben: “Figured we could help you with the instruments.”  
Chelsea: “Aww, thanks…”

I hug the two of them. Ben grunts a little.

Jordan: “You ready?”  
Chelsea: “Of course I am!”

We get up on stage and start setting up for the performance. I try to not think a lot about the fact Katorin’s sitting right there, and it seems to be pretty effective.

Once Jordan and Ben are set up and ready to go, I tap on the microphone, just to be sure it’s on.

Chelsea: “Hellooooo, everyone!”

The whole tavern goes wild, and Katorin cheers loudly. Her colleague sheephisly joins in.

Chelsea: “Wow, it’s… been a while since I’ve been up here.”

I nervously chuckle out of habit. Katorin leans in closer to her colleague to say something.

Chelsea: “Well, uh, I don’t really have a fancy intro prepared or anything. Who’s ready for some music?”

The crowd cheers.

Chelsea: “I’ll take that as a yes! Let’s get started, then!”

And, in an instant, I’ve jumped into my first number. A lot of people like my style of music, which was inspired by 80’s and new age music. Katorin’s jamming out in the corner of my eye, more than the rest of the crowd. She’s always so energetic; I’d chuckle if I could.

The night’s going so well. Everyone’s liking my live performance; or I’d like to think so, anyway. Maybe they’re all slammed from the drinks.

I look over to Katorin and wave slightly. her colleague must have noticed, because they’re looking at me, too.

*Oh, God… they’re looking at me…*

*and they’re just… so… cute!*

I barely keep my composure and keep signing. I hope they didn’t notice… God, I wish Katorin had said something before. No matter: I can’t be dwelling on this for long. I keep going with the performance and just shrug it off. I can just talk to her later.

---

I’m surprised I managed to keep my cool through the rest of the performance. Of course, everyone loved it, and I don’t think anyone noticed.

The closing band comes up and prepares their set as we come off stage. Jordan jabs his elbow into my side lightly by the time we get to the little backstage area.

Jordan: “You knocked it out the park again, Chelsea! You still got it.”  
Chelsea: “Oh, thanks! I wasn’t sure if I was that rusty with a live performance, or…”  
Ben: “Rusty? Nah. Everyone loved it.”

I hope I can get to Katorin before they leave.

Chelsea: “I’d love to chit-chat and all, but I gotta find Katorin and talk to her.”  
Ben: “She upset ya or something?”  
Chelsea: “What? No, it’s not like that, it’s something else.”  
Jordan: “We’ll still be here, then. But hey…”

Jordan reaches for a quick hug.

Jordan: “It was good performing with you again tonight.”  
Jordan: “Now, go find her!”  
Chelsea: “Thanks, Jordan and Ben. I’ll talk to you both later.”

I scurry off to the side and slip into the crowd, looking for Katorin. Thankfully, I see her over by the bar and slip in. This is going to be an awkward conversation, I feel it…

Chelsea: “Heey, bestie!”  
Katorin: “Chelsea! Hi!”

Katorin hugs me for a brief moment.

Katorin: “You were awesome up there tonight!”  
Chelsea: “Aww, thanks. Say, can I talk to you in private? Just really quick?”  
Katorin: “Oh, sure!”

She gets the bartender’s attention and points to the door. She nods while Katorin grabs my hand and walks out the front door, pulling me to the side.

Katorin: “What’s up? Did something happen?”

*Well, here goes…*

Chelsea: “You didn’t tell me your colleague was gonna be cute!”

Katorin: “… wh-what?”

Chelsea: “I noticed them looking at me during ‘Under the Sun’ and I couldn’t help but notice…”

Katorin chuckles.

Katorin: “That’s what you brought me out here for? You’re a funny pupper, Chelsea.”  
Chelsea: “What? I kinda like them…”

I start picking at my fingernails.

Katorin: “Well, this is an interesting turn of events.”  
Katorin: “I guess this will make my job of introducing-”  
Chelsea: “Do they have a partner?”

Katorin laughs.

Katorin: “No, they don’t. They’re open.”  
Katorin: “I wonder about you sometimes, Chelsea. I was going to say that I’d introduce them to you.”  
Chelsea: “Well, uh, about that…”  
Katorin: “What? You’re not nervous about meeting them, are you?”  
Chelsea: “No, it’s not like that, it’s…”  
Chelsea: “I was hoping to introduce myself to them…”

Not that I don’t Katorin or anything, but I’m just a little nervous when it comes to relationships. My previous ones dried up quickly, so I think a lot about doing this the right way.

Katorin: “Ah, I see. Yeah, that’s fine!”  
Katorin: “You have a plan or something? Because I was just going to take them backstage where Jordan and Ben are.”  
Chelsea: “Well, I wanted to talk somewhere else…”

Katorin looks at me before nodding. I can see the lightbulb go off in her head. 

*Uh oh…*

Katorin: “… you’re planning to show up in costume, aren’t you?”  
Chelsea: “W-what? No, nothing like that! I just…”

On second thought, that idea does seem plausible. I’m not afraid to show myself or anything, and I’m sure her colleague would be fine meeting an anthro-coyote like me. But I also really like wearing my costumes. I spend a lot of time creating them, and I feel like they’re a big part of me. Some like going with really pretty dresses or outfits; I like expressing myself in ways that seem counterintuitive.

Katorin: “You’re pondering. Man, I thought I had the upper hand on you!”  
Chelsea: “Well, it doesn’t sound like a bad idea…”

Katorin scoffs lightly.

Katorin: “I’m gonna regret giving you this idea, aren’t I?”  
Chelsea: “I hope not! You know what happened to the last times I tried to date someone.”  
Chelsea: “They never get that far!”  
Katorin: “I suppose you have a point. Perhaps I won’t regret it.”  
Katorin: “So how do you want to do this?”

I think for a moment. How do I want to go about this, exactly? I take a few seconds before I get an idea.

Chelsea: “Well… maybe I go to them?”

Katorin covers her face and sighs.

Katorin: “Chelsea, that’s gonna look suspicious.”  
Chelsea: “Not if I’m in costume…”  
Katorin: “Especially if you’re in costume! What the hell are you talking about?”  
Chelsea: “… you think a hammer is scary?”  
Katorin: “So you’re gonna have them think they’re tripping?”  
Chelsea: “Oh, come on, Katy! I’m trying my best here…”

I let out a short whine. I may not always act like a puppy, but I slip here and there. Katorin sighs.

Katorin: “Well, the least I could do is set their expectations so that they *don’t* think you’re a serial killer.”  
Katorin: “It’s a stretch, but-”

In a moment’s notice, I squeeze her and jump.

Chelsea: “Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! You won’t regret it!”  
Katorin: “No problem, you big goofy pupper…”

I eventually let go.

Katorin: “Just please don’t give off murderer vibes. Last thing I need is for them to not show up to work on Monday.”  
Chelsea: “You think this face is capable of murder?”  
Katorin: “God, you and your puppy eyes…”

I lightly giggle.

Katorin: “No, but… nevermind.”  
Katorin: “I’ll figure out something, but I’ll text you their address.”  
Katorin: “Please, don’t screw this up. For you, at least.”  
Chelsea: “Thank you, bestie…”  
Katorin: “Well, go on now, Marty! You got a costume to put on and someone to impress.”  
Chelsea: “You got it!”

I walk away from the tavern and walk down Bouchard Street. This is one of the silliest ideas I’ve ever done, but I’m sure Katorin will find a way to make this work.

---

Well, this is it. This is the address she gave me. I’m kinda nervous, but I think I’ll pull it off. Here goes nothing…

I knock on the door.

> Knocking sound plays.
> 

Some time passes. My heart’s racing. *Did they hear me? Are they alive?* Katorin did say that they were pretty buzzed…

I knock again for good measure, if not to just allay my worries.

> Knocking sound plays again.
> 

Colleague: "I'll be there!"

I sigh in relief. My heart eventually beats back into a normal-ish rate when Katorin’s colleague opens the door. They take a quick look at me and my costume, letter in hand. If this backfires, at least the letter should work…

Colleague: "I... have so many questions..."
Chelsea: "I won't be long, I promise. I'm just here to hand-deliver mail."  
Colleague: "So you must be the friend that Katorin was talking about, then."
Chelsea: "That would be correct. Here, maybe this will give you some answers."

I hand them the envelope.

Colleague: "... you couldn't just mail this?"
Colleague: "I, uh, didn't want to pay for postage..."

They look at me for a second, thinking. *Please tell me this will work…*

Colleague: “… Chelsea, isn’t it?”  
Chelsea: “I’m sorry?”  
Colleague: “You’re the one that performed tonight at the tavern, right?”  
Chelsea: “Oh, yeah, that’s me.”  
Colleague: “Huh. This is… interesting. I didn’t realize you had a hammer… costume…”

I chuckle nervously. *Yup, this is going as well as I expected…*

Chelsea: “Well, uh, I don’t wear costumes all the time.”  
Colleague: “I see. How come you’re wearing it now?”  
Colleague: “I hope I don’t give off anything to where you’d want to hide yourself…”  
Chelsea: “Oh, no! It’s nothing like that!”  
Chelsea: “I just wanted to try something different, you know? And spice up my introduction…”  
Colleague: “Oh, okay. Should I open this letter now, or… ?”

Considering this is going better than I expected, I guess I should tell them upfront.

Chelsea: “Well, I guess you don’t need to now. It was more of a backup for something I wanted to ask.”  
Chelsea: “I was, uh, wondering if you wanted to head to the café down the road with me some time…”

They stop for a second, quizzically looking at me. *Please tell me that’s a good thing…*

Colleague: “Like, on a date or something?”  
Chelsea: “Well, I mean if you’re comfortable with that. If you don’t want to, that’s fine, we could-”  
Colleague: “Sure.”  
Chelsea: “I-I’m sorry?”  
Colleague: “Sure, I’d like that. My Friday evenings are free, anyway.”

*Oh, sweet relief!* I quietly sigh to myself.

Colleague: “You know, this is a pretty weird way to ask someone out on a date. You do this often?”  
Chelsea: “Haha, not really… This is a first.”  
Chelsea: “I guess you could say the normal way of doing it doesn’t usually work for me.”  
Colleague: “Interesting. Does quarter to six tomorrow work for you?”  
Chelsea: “Yeah, that works for me.”  
Colleague: “Sounds like a plan, then.”  
Chelsea: “Thanks for giving me the chance, despite this…”

I gesture my hands to my dress.

Colleague: “Well, I suppose it could have been worse. Though that dress does look good on you.” 
Chelsea: “Oh, uh, thanks! I had a small wardrobe malfunction. It’s a long story.”

I weakly smile. I’d like to save the story of my more elaborate dress’s seams ripping for tomorrow.

Colleague: “Fair enough.”  
Chelsea: “Just one other quick question…”  
Chelsea: “Are you OK with me wearing this tomorrow? Maybe not the dress or anything, but at least the helmet?”  
Colleague: “You want to hide from the paparazzi or something?”  
Chelsea: “Haha, no. Thank goodness I don’t have one.”  
Chelsea: “But I kind of like wearing this helmet, at least. It’s a long story, but it feels like I get to be more of myself this way.”  
Colleague: “Like you want to be secretly a hammer or something, or…?”  
Chelsea: “Oh, no, I’m more than happy with who I am. I just like wearing costumes sometimes to express myself.”  
Colleague: “Oh, gotcha. I mean, if that makes you feel more comfortable, that’s fine by me.”  
Chelsea: “Thanks. It means a lot.”

I slightly look off to the side. I don’t think they can see me blushing. They chuckle lightly.

Colleague: “I never thought I’d put these words together, but…”  
Colleague: “God, you’re a cute hammer.”

I giggle a little. At least they appreciate the costume.

Chelsea: “Thanks…”  
Colleague: “Say, did Katorin tell you my name or anything like that?”  
Chelsea: “Well, not really, but…”  
Sam: “Sam. They/them pronouns.”

Sam offers their hand for a shake. I put my hand in and shake it.

Chelsea: “Chelsea. She/her or they/them pronouns.”  
Sam: “Perfect.”  
Sam: “I’d like to talk some more, but I’d like to get to bed and drink some more water so the hangover isn’t so bad. See you tomorrow?”  
Chelsea: “Sounds perfect. See you tomorrow.”  
Sam: “Alright, goodnight. Nice meeting you.”  
Chelsea: “Nice meeting you, too, and goodnight.”

I walk across the hallway to the elevator not long after Sam closes their door. As soon as I get into the elevator, I squeal.

Chelsea: “Yes! I did it!”

The other person in the elevator that I somehow didn’t see turns around and looks at me in confusion.

Chelsea: “Ehehe, long story…”

The person turns around and looks at their phone. *Whoops…*

But, man does it feel nice to finally go on a date with someone. I hope this goes well; Sam seems pretty nice and understanding.
