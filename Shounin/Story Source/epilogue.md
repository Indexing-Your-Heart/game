It’s been about six months since I’ve moved in with Sam, and it’s been really nice, living with them. I get to look out at the ocean as I write up some songs for my next album on my tablet, and Sam even makes pancakes for me sometimes. 

Sam recently took up a leadership role for a different software company and works remotely. Meanwhile, I’ve been working on more songs and even do freelance costume design on the side. Despite all this happening, we’ve still been dating all this while. Our relationship has grown stronger with no signs of stopping. I’m kind of surprised Sam hasn’t proposed yet.

I just barely make it through the door as I swing all the grocery bags inside and place them on the counter.

Chelsea: “I’m back! Man, that grocery store was really packed today…”

I hang the keys up and take my shoes off by the door. *There’s no response, either; maybe they went somewhere?* I make nothing of it and put the groceries away. After a waltz over to the couch, I notice a giant toolbox in place of the coffee table.

*… the heck?*

I get on my knees and investigate. I’ve never seen a toolbox this big before…

The box shakes, as if someone had knocked on it from inside. *Is Sam in there?* I carefully unlock and open the toolbox, unsure of what to find. Surprisingly, I see a person wearing… a nail costume? *Wait a minute… isn’t this my design?*

Sam: “Hey there.”

I yelp and bounce backwards, startled.

Chelsea: “Sam! Bloody hell, you scared me!”

Sam laughs, rising from the toolbox.

Sam: “I didn’t mean to scare you, sorry…”

I calm down, recovering from the little jumpscare.

Chelsea: “Where’d you get the costume from?”  
Sam: “I know someone who makes costumes…”  
Chelsea: “Me? When did I…?”  
Sam: “Anonymous request.”  
Chelsea: “… oh. Right…”  
Sam: “Why don’t you join me? I think you’d like this little toolbox fort.”  
Chelsea: “I don’t know, looks a bit cramped.”  
Sam: “Ah, come on, I know you’re not claustrophobic….”  
Chelsea: “I suppose you’re right. Give me a second.”

I walk over to the bedroom, shut the door, and don my hammer helmet and black dress. Waltzin back to the toolbox, I gently step inside. Sam closes the lid and turns on some LED lights.

Chelsea: “Where’d you get these from?”  
Sam: “Amozin. I bought them a year ago before I met you.”  
Chelsea: “Oh.”  
Sam: “I made this toolbox like a little pillow fort.”

I look around and notice all the decorations and a small box of nails in the corner. It really does feel like a pillow fort my father and I used to make when I was a young pup.

Chelsea: “Huh. Yeah…”  
Chelsea: “How long did this take to set up?”  
Sam: “Five minutes, give or take.”  
Chelsea: “And you set all this up while I went to go get groceries?”  
Sam: “Yeah, it was quick and easy.”  
Chelsea: “Wow…”  

I look at Sam, who is now propped up against the fabric wall lining the toolbox structure held up with PVC pipes.

Chelsea: “This is really interesting, talking to a nail…”  
Sam: “It’s just as interesting talking to the hammer in the same toolbox.”

I giggle. Sam slides over and gently kicks the box of nails in my direction with their feet.

Chelsea: “You want me to grab another nail from the box or something?”  
Chelsea: “And I could’ve sworn I made some velcro holes for arms…”

Sam undoes the velcro for said holes and sticks their arms out.

Sam: “Of course you did. I just felt lazy.”

They take the box of nails and put it in their hands. *What in the world are they doing…?*

Sam: “Now, Miss Hammer…”  
Sam: “We’ve in this same toolbox for as long as I can remember.”

We’ve only been in here for about a few minutes, but I shrug off the comment. Maybe they were being symbolic.

Sam: “And we’ve been a really good duo. Like we were meant for each other.”

*Oh… is this really happening? I think I know what’s in that box…*

Sam: “How about we hammer this in, really?”

They open the box, revealing a diamond ring, glistening in the warm LED lights. *Holy crap…*

Sam: “Chelsea, will you marry me?”

This really is happening! I have a hard time articulating my words, resorting to a combination of laughter and tears of joy.

Chelsea: “Oh, my God, yes, you dork!”

We brace for a hug and laugh together as we bathe in the warm lights. This is it; I’m going to be spending the rest of my days with the love of my life. And I couldn’t be happier.

Sam: “If I’m honest, this is the best proposal idea I’ve had for months.”  
Chelsea: “I think you nailed it.”

We cuddle for a while, absorbing our surroundings and not having a care in the world. Sam wraps their arms around me and I look up at them.

Sam: “We’re quite a couple aren’t we?”

I nod in agreement. Sam squeezes me a little. *Ooh, spicy…*

Chelsea: “Whoa, nail! Whatever happens in this toolbox…”

I flick my finger under their chin.

Chelsea: “The helmet stays on during sex.”

Sam laughs. They unzip the back of their costume and bodysuit, respectively, revealing their face. I take off my helmet and carefully set it aside.

Sam: “So, how about some burgers to celebrate?”

I giggle.

Chelsea: “Sure, it’s settled.”
