It's been at least a year since I've gone on a hike, and I must have fallen out of shape since then. I can barely keep up with Chelsea, who is yards away from me. She doesn't seem to mind, though.

Player: "Hey, wait up!"

Chelsea stops at a nearby tree and turns around. She leans her arm against the tree and crosses her legs.

Chelsea: "Gee, [Player]! I didn't realize just how out of shape you are!"
Player: "It's been a while, alright?"

Chelsea smiles as I walk over to her. She pulls out a water bottle from the side of her bag.

Chelsea: "Here. You'll want to stay hydrated."

I open the bottle and take a sip. Chelsea grabs the other water bottle and drinks some of it.

Player: "Thanks."
Chelsea: "We're almost at the top. Should be there in about ten, maybe fifteen, minutes."
Player: "Oh, good."
Chelsea: "It'll be easier on the way down. Trust me."

She grabs the bottles and puts them back on the sides of the bag and turns around. We keep walking up the rough terrain. I still can't believe it's only been eight months since she took her helmet off and, more importantly, since we got serious with this relationship of ours. So serious, in fact, that we got engaged a month ago.

I can see her ring shimmer in the sunlight as we take a sharp turn around the boulder and up to the next trail marker. I've nearly forgotten what they mean, but I trust that Chelsea knows at least enough to navigate the trail. We eventually reach a fork in the path. Incidentally, Chelsea and I split, with her taking the right path, and me the left. After a few seconds, she turns around, realizing I wasn't behind her.

Chelsea: "Oi! [Player]! Wrong way!"
Player: "Don't these lead to the same place?"

Chelsea walks over to me.

Chelsea: "The marker says to go to the right, silly."
Chelsea: "You see how the squares are leaning to the right?"

She points to the trail marker posted on the tree, showing two squares leaning to the right.

Player: "Oh. My bad."
Chelsea: "It really has been a long time since you've last hiked, hasn't it?"
Player: "Yeah. It has."

Chelsea grabs my hands and walks over to her path.

Chelsea: "Papa used to take me on this trail all the time when I was a little pup."
Chelsea: "He'd teach me everything about hiking."
Chelsea: "He even let me lead the way, relying on the trail markers for guidance."
Chelsea: "He doesn't do it a lot nowadays because he's getting older."
Chelsea: "I wouldn't want him throwing his back out up here."
Player: "Me either."

We stop for a brief moment while Chelsea looks off to the side.

Chelsea: "Wowie... look at that river down there, [Player]!"

Chelsea points to a river toward the bottom of the hill, which continues to flow and meander about.

Chelsea: "I've never seen the river flowing this much."
Chelsea: "Something must have cleared up somewhere to let this happen."
Chelsea: "It's so pretty to watch..."

I grab her hand while she continues to watch the river for a brief moment. Eventually, Chelsea and I get back on track and continue walking up and around the hill. Carefully, we climb up some boulders and keep moving until we eventually make it up to the top of the incline.

Chelsea: "We're here!"

I stand right next to her and look off to the distance while regaining my breath. It's a very clear view, and I can make out a lot of the areas we just hiked. The waterfall rushes down the side of a nearby mountain, feeding into the river we looked at earlier.  I can barely make out the road we traveled on to get to the trail.

Chelsea: "Isn't it beautiful?"
Player: "As beautiful as you are."

Chelsea giggles.

Chelsea: "Here, let's take a seat on this rock."

We saunter over to the rock and take a seat. Chelsea pulls out the water bottles and hands me my bottle.

Player: "Thanks."

I take the bottle from her and drink from it. She opens her bottle up and drinks.

Player: "So, about those numbers on Tropify..."
Chelsea: "I know. It's still hard for me to wrap my head around it."
Chelsea: "Trending at number five on the list. I never tought I'd see the day!"
Player: "I'm proud of you, Chels."
Chelsea: "I'm proud of you, too, ArcAI web development department head."
Player: "I wonder if someone's gonna catch us making out on this rock soon."
Chelsea: "Who cares if someone does?"
Chelsea: "Besides, almost everyone in town knows we're engaged."
Chelsea: "This shouldn't be news to them."
Player: "True, I suppose."

Chelsea giggles lightly.

Chelsea: "It only feels like I met you last week."
Chelsea: "I didn't think we'd make it this far as a couple."
Player: "I don't know. I kinda dig hammers."
Player: "At least I don't have to go to the hardware store to find the best one of the bunch."
Chelsea: "Well, I guess you could say we nailed it."

We laugh for a moment and take another drink from our bottles. We could practically stay up here for hours.

Player: "I love you, you goofy puppy."
Chelsea: "Love you, too, monkey head."

We lean in and kiss for a short moment. I couldn't be more grateful for all of this. Things are going to get even better from here, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for me and my future wife.
