I can’t see or feel anything anymore. I’ve isolated myself from the rest of the world, hiding away in a dark corner that no one will bother to check. I can scream and cry as loud as I want, but no one can listen.

I’ve been on this couch for days now, sobbing out a waterfall with no end in sight. I can’t bring myself to get out of the house, especially after that *monster* invaded my space. I’m drowning in my own tears like a lost puppy, unsure of where to go. I’m pretty sure this burrito costume of mine has absorbed every last drop. *I can’t let Sam see me like this…*

> A knocking sound plays.
> 

*No… please, go away…* I lay in silence, praying that whoever’s at that door will leave.

> A knocking sound plays again.
> 

Sam: “Hello? Is anyone home?”

*Crap: it’s Sam…* I whine quietly and stay still, hoping that they leave. Not that I want to scare them away… How did I end up in this mess?

Well, I guess I have to respond now. I begrudgingly get up from the couch and hop my way over to the door, falling short of opening it.

Chelsea: “Sam, I-I’m not really in a g-good place right now…”  
Sam: “Are you alright?”

I try to form words, but I struggle to even form a cohesive thought. I slide down the door, sobbing again. *The pain… it hurts…*

Sam: “I’m sorry, I didn’t realize…”  
Sam: “Can I help in any way?”

Do I tell them to leave and lay here in silence? Do I let them in? It hurts to even think about it.

Sam: “I can come back another time, if you wish.”

*No, I’d better not.* I get up and gently pry open the door wide enough for them to get through. I slide down the wall again, barely keeping my tears in place as they slide through door and close it. Sam quickly looks around the old mansion before sitting on the floor right next to me.

Sam: “Have you been crying all this time?”  
Chelsea: “M-maybe…”  
Sam: “Here, let’s get you to the couch. The floor’s not gonna be that comfortable.”

Sam gently picks me up, carries me to the couch, and takes a seat while still holding me in their arms. Between sniffling and whimpering, I can barely form a sentence. Sam pulls me closer and rubs my arm. The warmth from their body and their movements somewhat calms me.

Sam: “What’s going on?”  
Chelsea: “M-my mother showed up…”  
Sam: “Oh, God; I’m so sorry.”

Sam hugs me while I whimper.

Sam: “That’s gotta be rough. Your father’s told me a little bit.”  
Chelsea: “… you talked to him?”  
Sam: “I went with Katorin to get her new blouse altered at his shop.”  
Sam: “We chatted for a little bit, and he told me about your mother. I’m really sorry.”  
Sam: “No one should have to go through that, ever.”  
Sam: “I’m guessing things didn’t go well here if she showed up randomly.”

I try to muster up the courage to respond. I don’t want to relive the event. I don’t want it to hurt any more than it does.

Sam: “It’s okay if you don’t want to get into the details. I don’t want to see you in more pain.”

Sam keeps rubbing my arm and holding me close. The pain starts to slowly go away.

Chelsea: “I-it hurts… it’s like she doesn’t see *me* anymore.”  
Chelsea: “Just a shell of what she wants to see.”  
Chelsea: “‘God damn it, Chester, why can’t you be normal for once?’ That’s all I’d hear her say.”  
Chelsea: “She kept throwing things a-at me. Slurs, too.”  
Sam: “That’s just horrible. I’m really sorry.”

I cuddle up closer to them, letting their warmth continue to put me at ease.

Sam: “Well, I don’t care what she says, but you’re still a beautiful and quirky coyote.”  
Sam: “Even if you’re a burrito right now.”

I let out a little whine, just shy of a giggle, while letting my head pop out the top of my burrito cocoon.

Chelsea: “Thank you…”

Sam rubs the side of my muzzle with their thumb. We stare into each other’s eyes for a short while, drowning out the rest of the world. *The pain… I can’t feel it anymore…*

I rest my eyes for a bit and lean against Sam’s chest while they rub my arm. *Finally, I’m at peace again.* We stay in silence for a few minutes as I catch a moment of respite. However, it doesn’t last long when I feel Sam moving their arm. As I open my eyes, Sam reaches for their phone in their pocket. They look at the screen for brief moment before setting it next to the couch.

Sam: “Weird, no calls or anything?”  
Chelsea: “Did something happen?”  
Sam: “I thought my phone vibrated, but I guess not.”  
Chelsea: “Vibrated?”

I think for a moment, pondering what they felt. Then, it hits me…

Chelsea: “Ah, s-sorry! I, uh…”  
Sam: “Why would you be sorry? I don’t understand.”  
Chelsea: “Your phone didn’t vibrate. That must’ve been me.”  
Chelsea: “I… I’m an occasional compulsive toe wiggler.”  
Sam: “Wait, what?”  
Chelsea: “I fell asleep for just a second and I guess I…”  
Sam: “It’s okay! You don’t need to apologize for anything.”

I scoot under Sam’s arm again.

Chelsea: “I’m sorry, it’s just… I get really conscious about it.”

I shuffle and kick a bit, struggling to find where the bottom zipper on the costume is.

Chelsea: “Where… is the… bloody zipper on this… thing?!”  
Chelsea: “*whimpers* I knew I should’ve used Velcro… ah, forget it!”  
Sam: “You need help?”

I start whimpering again, placing my paws on top of Sam’s hands to prevent them from doing anything.

Chelsea: “I can’t stand to look at my paws with this ugly nail color.”  
Chelsea: “I-I haven’t painted my toenails since a few weeks ago, but I don’t have any nail polish…”  
Sam: “Surely they aren’t that bad, right?”

Sam slides their hands from under me and gently unzips the bottom of my little cocoon, revealing my paws. I whimper again.

Sam: “What do you mean? I think your paws look pretty with the natural color.”  
Chelsea: “… you do? That’s…”

No one’s ever said anything like that to me before. It feels so weird… but also so satisfying… I both giggle and whimper simultaneously.

Sam: “You OK? You want me to zip this back up for you?”  
Chelsea: “No one’s commented on my paws before…”  
Sam: “Oh, my apologies. I’m not into that kind of thing if…”

For the first time in a week, I giggle.

Chelsea: “It’s fine, really! I just take pride in them.”  
Chelsea: “You know, like how Katy’s proud of her, um, assets…”  
Sam: “Oh, okay. Still not that kind of person, though.”  
Chelsea: “It’s fine, I get it. I tend to stay away from those kind of people anyway.”  
Chelsea: “Besides my besties, I think you’re the only person who’s made that kind of compliment without being creepy about it.”  
Chelsea: “You know how many people make that kind of compliment and then get really weird with me about it?”

Sam smiles.

Sam: “Well, I can only imagine.”  
Chelsea: “It’s… rough. That’s why I just don’t say anything about it anymore.”  
Chelsea: “That is, until now…”  
Sam: “Hey, as long as you feel beautiful all over, I don’t mind.”

I lightly giggle again as I lean my head against their chest. *Finally, I don’t have to feel awkward about it…* I end up toe-wiggling again, this time being completely aware of it.

Sam: “You know, I don’t think your toe-wiggling is compulsive.”  
Chelsea: “… hmm? What do you mean?”  
Sam: “You know how your family members don’t have tails?”  
Chelsea: “Yeah, what about it?”  
Sam: “Maybe your toe-wiggling is the equivalent of you wagging your non-existent tail.”  
Chelsea: “How come?”  
Sam: “Because I’ve noticed you only do it when you’re happy or feeling loved.”  
Chelsea: “Huh…”

*Is that so?* I think about all the times I’ve done it, recalling the circumstances. And it does seem to hold up…

Chelsea: “Maybe you’re right. I’ve never thought about it that way.”  
Sam: “I’m just speculating, but it’s something.”

I giggle and keep cuddling with Sam for a while until my stomach growls.

Sam: “Ooh, sounds like you haven’t eaten in a while…”  
Chelsea: “Not since this morning.”  
Sam: “Let’s fill that belly of yours. You want Chinese food?”  
Chelsea: “Sure, I haven’t had it in a while.”  
Sam: “Then it’s settled.”  
Chelsea: “Could we get some ice cream, too? I’m kind of craving it…”  
Sam: “Sure thing.”

Sam strokes my hair and tries to reach for the phone, but I kick it in their direction.

Sam: “Well, thank you, Miss Burrito.”

I giggle again. I’m so glad that they’re here with me, and I don’t have to feel alone or awkward…
