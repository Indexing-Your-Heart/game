It’s been a few weeks since I was at Sam’s place, incredibly exhausted and concerned, still shaken up from everything that happened. I seem to be in a better state now, like myself again. Just being with Sam, someone who clearly cares for me and was available, made it better. I think I ended up sleeping on there couch by accident, but we seem to agree that nothing happened. Well, nothing beyond that first kiss… hehe.

Thankfully, that hiccup didn’t affect our relationship or the frequency of dating. We’ve still been going strong for the past few weeks. We went to Kellhim Park again a few times, and we even went to that burger joint just around the corner from my place. I think it was Fettuccine’s or something like that. I just remember that the name was weird, but the food was so good and juicy… but, I digress.

I have no idea what’s in store for tonight. It’s the day I finally cross the 4-bit limit, and I’m kinda nervous. Not because of Sam or anything, but who knows what they have up their sleeve for me. At least they’ve kept the promise of keeping my birthday on the down low…

I gently knock Sam’s door and wait patiently, looking down at my shoes. They’re the only thing that stick out from the rest of the outfit I have… Thankfully, I don’t have to think too much about it; I hear Sam opening the door.

Sam: “Hey there, birthday girl! Happy 32nd.”  
Chelsea: “Thanks…”

I blush and turn my head.

Sam: “You have a really cute outfit today. Where’d you get the dress?”  
Chelsea: “Thanks, I made it myself!”  
Sam: “So you make costumes and clothes? That’s impressive.”

I lightly giggle.

Sam: “Please, come in. I got something for you!”  
Chelsea: “Oh?”

I follow Sam’s gesture and step inside, taking off my shoes by the front door. I walk over to the couch where Sam stands and take a seat.

Sam: “Aww, you have matching socks for your top! That’s adorable.”

I blush.

Chelsea: “Hehe, I got them when I wanted to make a birthday cake costume. I never got around to that.”  
Chelsea: “So I just wear them on special days like this…”

I notice the boxes on the coffee table for a brief second, though I quickly redirect my attention to Sam.

Sam: “Birthday cake costume? I wonder how that would’ve looked, knowing you…”  
Chelsea: “Well, maybe I can get a prototype for you someday.”  
Sam: “I’m sure it’d be fun to explore. Here…”

Sam grabs one of the boxes and hands it to me. It feels a bit heavier than I expected. Coincidentally, the wrapping paper has the same design as both my dress and socks.

Chelsea: “How did you manage to get identical wrapping paper?”  
Sam: “You know, I have no idea. Pure coincidence.”  
Sam: “If I’ve learned anything from you, what’s inside is much more valuable, though…”

I smirk at them as I rip off the wrapping paper, revealing a boxed… Lotus Pad?

Chelsea: “No way… you serious?”  
Sam: “I know your computer’s on its last legs, so I wanted to get something that’s as flexible as you are.”  
Sam: “Now, time for this next box.”  
Chelsea: “Next box?”

*Just how much did they spend on me? Jeez…* Sam hands me a much smaller and more rectangular box. I carefully rip off the wrapping paper again, just a little hesitant to see what’s inside.Quickly, I discover that I’m holding the stylus for the tablet. I’m so overwhelmed, I’m at a loss for words; instead, I let out a little puppy yelp.

Sam: “After seeing your handwritten lyrics all across the coffee table at your house, I figured getting the stylus will do wonders for you.”  
Sam: “That way, you can write the way you always have and have a digital copy, freeing up some space.”  
Chelsea: “Aww…”  
Sam: “There’s more.”

*More?* I know programmers at ArcAI make a lot of money, but, *damn…* Sam hands me a thinner box about the same dimensions of the table itself. I start ripping open this present, too.

Chelsea: “How much did you spend on all of this, Sam?”  
Sam: “Not to worry: I ended up getting a really good deal.”

After setting the wrapping paper aside, I see the box in my hands: the official keyboard case for the tablet.

Sam: “So you can use it like your old computer, if you want. I think the white one looks better than the other color they had for your particular color.”  
Chelsea: “You really thought of everything for this, didn’t you?”  
Sam: “Of course. I wanted to make sure you got the best.”

Sam boops my muzzle. I lightly giggle.

Chelsea: “Thank you, this really means a lot…”  
Sam: “There’s just one more thing, though.”

Sam pulls out a large box from behind their back, wrapped in a different shiny wrapping paper.

Sam: “This just came in today and I wrapped it an hour ago. It took a while to get here.”

I quizzically look at them as I start unwrapping the box. I notice the brown cardboard box as soon as I pull off the wrapping paper. *What is this; what could have they possibly gotten me that took this long to get to here?* I carefully start to open the lid of the box.

Sam: “It’s adorable watching you open this. It’s like watching a puppy play around with a shiny new toy in which they have no idea how it works.”

I smirk as I lift the tissue paper underneath the lid of the box. And that’s when I noticed a pair of grey sneakers in the box.

Chelsea: “Oh, my God…”  
Sam: “I felt kinda bad that you couldn’t find a good pair of shoes with a neutral color. So, I did some asking around and got ahold of this brand.”  
Sam: “They’ve made custom versions of this pair of sneakers for anthros before, and I  was able to get a custom size made for you.”  
Chelsea: “Aww, I can’t believe you did this…”

I start tearing up and try to hold back. I can’t believe they’d go through all that hard work just for me. Sam leans in for a hug just before I start to lose control of my tears.

Sam: “Happy birthday, pupper.”  
Chelsea: “Thank you…”

We keep hugging for a long while, and it’s felt like the best hug I’ve ever had. I haven’t felt this way since I was a little pup just before I was going to transition.

In a moment’s notice, we gracefully break from the hug. By now the tears have stopped, though I still sniffle occasionally. I look down at the sneakers, still pristine in their box.

Chelsea: “You cool with me trying these on?”  
Sam: “Of course! I’m hoping they fit just right.”

I take the sneakers out of the box, remove the paper from inside them, and put them on. As soon as my paws)touch the ground, I and unexpectedly nice cushion. I pace around the room, occasionally looking at my kicks.

Chelsea: “Oh, this feels so *comfortable*! It feels like I’m walking on clouds.”  
Sam: “They look great on you.”

I end up wiggling my toes in delight, unaware of the sneakers following my movement. I squeal lightly like it’s the best thing since sliced bread. My teal shoes feel like clunkers in comparison to this…

Sam: “I’m sure you didn’t want your tail-wagging alternative to feel that hidden away, so I made sure to find you a pair where you’d feel happy to, uh, show off down there.”

I giggle lightly. They know me too well, even if there exists people who take a little too much interest in that. I come over to them and gently sit on their lap like a child going to visit Santa Claus.

Sam: “How do you feel?”  
Chelsea: “Like the prettiest pupper in the world.”

I lean in for a short kiss, and Sam smooches me on the top of my muzzle. After looking into their eyes for long enough, I realize the one thing I wanted to show them: the new burrito costume I made for my photo shoot this morning.

Chelsea: “Do you have any other surprises up your sleeve?”  
Sam: “Well, I was going to serve dinner, but if you had something in mind…”  
Chelsea: “Yeah, there’s a new costume I wanted to show you.”  
Sam: “New costume?”  
Chelsea: “For my photo shoot for my new album this morning.”  
Sam: “Oh! Okay, sure. However you want to do it.”  
Chelsea: “Just give me a few minutes, and I’ll let you know when I’m ready.”

I walk over to the bedroom and close the door. I take off my new sneakers and set them aside the dresser. Being as quiet and speedy as I can, I switch into the new burrito costume I made, sealing up all the velcro spots and making sure the fake foil stuck. Gently, I lay myself on the bed and call out to Sam. In moments, they come in and sit on the side of the bed.

Sam: “Huh, the foil’s new.”  
Chelsea: “That’s not the only new thing, you know.”  
Chelsea: “You wanna bite? I’ll let you pick which side…”  
Sam: “Well, aren’t you getting a little spicy… how about this one?”

Sam peels off the fake foil and inadvertently grabs my legs. I stifle a giggle well enough for them not to notice.

Sam: “So, what’s new about this version, pupper?”

I go with the flow and kick the bottom velcro open. Sam gasps, realizing their mistake whilst looking at the now open side.

Sam: “Oh, how did I do that?”  
Chelsea: “Heey, that’s the side *you* chose…”. 
Sam: “Gee, how was I gonna know? Both sides look the same.”

I cackle and reorient myself, leaning against them and pushing my paws through the holes in the bottom.

Sam: “So you only changed the bottom?”  
Chelsea: “Of course not!”

I undo the velcro on my sides and push my arms through the newly created holes.

Sam: “Oh, you have arms! Weird!”  
Chelsea: “The whole front half comes off, too.”  
Chelsea: “We agreed on a shot where I pull the front off, but they froze the frame, I think.”  
Sam: “Well, now I wonder who’d buy an album with a burrito like that on it…”  
Chelsea: “People who eat dogs, apparently.”

Sam and I cackle for a while before they pull me closer, pulling off just enough the front to reveal my head.

Sam: “Hi there.”  
Chelsea: “Hey.”

Naturally, we end up making out a little. I couldn’t feel any happier. We stop after a few minutes, and Sam strokes my hair.

Sam: “So, what’s next, Miss Burrito?”  
Chelsea: “Maybe going for a bite and some puzzles.”  
Sam: “Sure, whatever you’d like.”

---

We spend the next hour or so eating a split pea soup Sam made for me, setting up my new tablet, and playing a puzzle game I’ve wanted to play for a while. They somehow managed to get my father’s recipe and nail it. That’s dedication.

Sam strokes my hair as I lay on top of them on the couch, waltzing through the world in search of more puzzles.

Sam: “You still looking for a place on this side of town?”  
Chelsea: “I want to, but I haven’t really looked since… *the event*.”  
Sam: “… you wanna move in with me?”  
Chelsea: “… move… in?”

*Are they really offering to let me stay with them? Oh, my God…*

Sam: “Yeah. I mean, we’ve been partners for a while now.”  
Sam: “At the very least, I’d trust you as a good housemate.”

*This… this is really happening…*

Chelsea: “You’d do that for me?”  
Sam: “I’m not dating anyone else…”

I set the tablet on the table, flip around, and hug them while I let out a little puppy squeal.

Sam: “I’ll take that as a yes. I can help you pack later.”  
Chelsea: “Thank you…”  
Sam: “Only for my favorite pupper.”

Sam says that last part while booping me. This has been the best birthday of my life; I doubt there will be anything that tops this in a long, long while…
