I can't believe it's nearly been a week since I last received the letter from that... hammer and agreed on a first date at Le Papillon's Pâtisserie. This is all so surreal; I can't believe anything that's happening right now. I'm not completely nervous because I've gone on dates before. But there's this feeling of doubt.

I check the time on my watch: 5:39 PM. It's only just a couple of minutes before the hammer shows up. I take a seat on a bench nearby and look off to the distance. A lot of cars drive down the road to the waterfront. It's not unusual for a Friday night, but it's interesting to watch.

A few minutes pass, and I eventually see the hammer walking down the sidewalk, looking around. They eventually spot me on the bench; that is, it appears that way, given the head tilting backwards. I get up and walk over to them at the entrance of the pastry shop.

"What should I say?"

- "I didn't think you'd wear the hammer costume again."
    - Hammer: "I, uh, like to keep things consistent, I guess."
- "You're the same person that knocked on my door last week, right?"
    - Hammer: "Yup, that would be me!"
- "You look like you're ready to build something."
    - Hammer: "Haha! I'll take that as a compliment."

Hammer: "It's good to see that you don't look plastered like the last time."
Player: "Thank goodness. The drink Katorin bought me was strong."
Hammer: "I heard."

The hammer lightly giggles.

(Choice)

- "Are we heading to a costume party?"
    - Hammer: "No, no, not at all! I'm sorry if I confused you."
    - Hammer: "I just like wearing this one a lot."
- "Do you want to head inside?"
    - Hammer: "I'd love to so I can grab some pastries for my father."
    - Hammer: "But maybe a bit later. I don't want them to get particularly stale."
- "Where are we headed?"
    - Hammer: "I, uh, didn't really plan this far..."
    - Hammer: "I'm sorry if I disappointed you in not having prepared anything."

Hammer: "Umm... how about we head down to the waterfront?"
Player: "Fine by me."

The two of us start sauntering down the road, and I manage to get a side profile of the costume. They must've spent hours designing the helmet and getting the circumference of the dress piece just right.

Player: "Your costume is extremely detailed. May I ask who made it?"
Hammer: "Well, that would be me! And thanks."

Player: "You did?"
"You have quite some artistic talent."
Hammer: "That's... a first I've heard from someone."
Player: "A first?"
Hammer: "Not a lot of people really appreciate the blood, sweat, and tears I pour into these things..."
Hammer: "It's complicated."
"It looks cute on you, or whatever I can see on you."
The hammer giggles.
Hammer: "I guess you think hammers are cute, then."
Player: "Well, I can tell you spend a lot of time making a costume that fits you."
Hammer: "I try. Not a lot people really see that, though..."

Hammer: "I'm not really sure if that's a good topic for a first date, though."
Player: "Alright, fair enough."
Player: "Say, will I get to see what you look like without the costume?"
Hammer: "Maybe. I guess that depends on how long this lasts."
Player: "Alright, then. Keep your secrets."

The hammer giggles again. We turn on Sun Valley Road in the general direction of my apartment.

Hammer: "The waterfront's nice this evening. I don't really get to see it often."
Player: "Really? I'm surprised. I nearly see this every day."
Hammer: "Oh, you live on the waterfront?"
Player: "Yup, over there."

I point to my apartment building.

Hammer: "Oh, that's nice!"
Hammer: "You get to see the waves crash onto the beach all the time."
Hammer: "I'm a little jealous, hehe..."
Player: "It's nice to see the view from out the window."

Hammer: "Ah, now you got to rub it in my face, you!"

- "You can see it from my apartment sometime soon."
    - Hammer: "Well, I guess that's true..."
    - Hammer: "But still, no need to rub it in..."
    - The hammer pokes my chest jokingly.
    - Player: "Well, my apologies if I'm being too problematic."
    - Hammer: "Ahaha, it's fine. I'm just teasing."
- "Why haven't you moved down to the waterfront?"
    - Hammer: "It's kind of a long story, but I just haven't found an affordable place."
    - Hammer: "It kinda sucks being on the other side of the city, but it has its benefits, too, I suppose..."
    - Player: "Other side of town?"
    - Hammer: "Uh, yeah, just off of Collins."
    - Player: "Wow, that far out..."
    - Hammer: "It's not too far from where my father lives."
    - Hammer: "Just more convenient to go around the block than across town."
    - Hammer: "But my father's moved to somewhere else now, so there's no real reason to be where I am."
    - Hammer: "I'm sure I'll get over here someday!"

Player: "I guess you really enjoy the water."
Hammer: "Yeah..."
Hammer: "It's funny, really. My friends always think I'd *hate* being anywhere near water."
Player: "Why's that?"
Hammer: "Eh, long story."

We stop for a brief moment, near Sun Valley Café. I usually swing by there every morning to grab some coffee on the go. Thankfully, it's on the way to work.

Player: "You want to head into the café?"
Hammer: "Ah! I, uh, I'm not sure..."
Player: "Is coffee not your thing, or... ?"
Hammer: "No, no, no, it's nothing like that! I actually don't mind a good cup."
Hammer: "It's just, uh..., it'd be a little tricky for me to... enjoy it..."
Player: "You're really insistent on wearing that costume the entire time, aren't you?"
Hammer: "Ehehe... maybe..."
Player: "You don't need to drink anything if you don't want to."
Hammer: "How about we do that next time? I promise I'll have a solution by then!"
Player: "Umm… What do you mean?"
Hammer: "I'll make some alterations."
Player: "Isn't that overengineering the solution? You could just take off your helmet."
Hammer: "Well, yeah, but..."

I'm not going to get anywhere with this hammer at this rate, it seems. They're insistent on this whole anonymity scheme.

Player: "I'm sorry for pushing it. I get it, if you're trying to go for one of those blind date kind experiences."
Hammer: "What? Oh, it's nothing like that, it's just..."
Hammer: "This is kind of the first time I've really gotten this far in a relationship."
Hammer: "I just don't wanna screw it up."
Player: "Huh. So you're saying this whole costume thing is the result of that?"
Hammer: "Well, yeah..."
Player: "You know, you didn't have to go through all this trouble. You already did the hard work of even just asking me out."
Player: "I feel like we've settled it as is. But if you want to keep the anonymity for now, I don't mind."
Player: "I just don't want you to get the impression that taking off your helmet is going to turn this around all of a sudden."
Hammer: "Ehe, but that's the thing... I know it will."
Hammer: "But thanks for at least understanding."
Player: "Let's just skip the café, then. I guess we can just head up to my place."
Hammer: "Uh, are you sure about that?"
Player: "Whoa, nothing like that! I could take you somewhere else, but it'd be dark by the time we get there."
Player: "And besides, I can't think of any place to take you."
Hammer: "That's fair, I suppose. Sorry for being so stubborn."

The two of us keep walking until we reach the intersection between Sun Valley Road and Federighi Avenue. After turning the bend and walking up to the entrance, I guide the hammer through the complex all the way to my apartment. I open the door and hold it open to let the hammer pass through.

Hammer: "Wow, this is really tidy!"
Player: "I try."

I close the door as I walk into my apartment.

Hammer: "How much did the furniture cost?"
Player: "Oh, umm... I don't remember. I got it about five, maybe ten, years ago."
Hammer: "Oh..."
Player: "There's a furniture store in the area. I think it's by the dealership on Narock Boulevard."
Hammer: "Down there? Huh, I haven't seen it in the time I've been down there."
Player: "I guess they might've closed, then."
Hammer: "That's a shame. I would've loved to get something like this."
Hammer: "So clean and modern... my place looks like it came out of the 1800s."
Hammer: "I can't complain, though. I got the furniture with the place."
Player: "Can't really beat that, I guess. Here, take a seat."

I gesture to the couch as I stand near the armchair.  While I take a seat in the armchair, the hammer walks over to the couch, takes their shoes off, and sits on the couch, legs up and tucked away.

Hammer: "The cushions feel really nice."
Player: "Yeah. Sometimes more comfortable than my bed."
Hammer: "Mine at home is a little flat. I guess it's so old that they've flattened over time."
Hammer: "Doesn't really help my-, uh, behind."
Player: "You don't need to filter yourself."
Hammer: "Ahaha, it's a little more complicated than that."
Player: "Alright, if you say so."

The hammer adjusts themselves a little.

Hammer: "So, uh, [Player]... did you have a good time last week?"
Player: "Eh? What kind of question is that?"
Hammer: "Well, last time I saw you, you looked like you were completely slammed."
Player: "Oh, that. Well, I didn't expect Katorin to give me a drink that strong."
Player: "I'm not much of a drinker, really. But I enjoyed the show."
Player: "And I guess Katorin got her round of excitement from introducing me to the band."
Hammer: "Oh, you got to meet the band! That must've been nice."
Player: "It kind of was. Maybe not while being drunk, but still..."
Player: "Oddly enough, the lead singer left early. Apparently they had some matters to tend to."
Hammer: "Oh..."
Player: "I sure got the shock of my life, though. I had thought they made an intricate costume."
Hammer: "What kind of costume?"
Player: "I thought the band decided to wear animal themed costumes for the night."
Player: "Then one of the band members told me that the lead singer..."

I lightly chuckle.

Player: "yeah..."
Hammer: "What about the lead singer?"
Player: "They're an anthro. I almost forgot that a few live around here in New Rollinsport."
Player: "Like, I have a few colleagues on the marketing team. They make some mean chili."
Player: "Not once did I even question their origin."
Player: "Man, I was really plastered that night..."
Hammer: "Ah, well, you can't blame yourself for that."
Hammer: "I'm sure the regulars would think the same."
Player: "They were cute, though. That is, the lead singer, not my colleagues."

The hammer giggles.

Hammer: "I know what you mean."
Hammer: "Well, at least you had a fun night."
Player: "I'd better have! We were celebrating the release of Project Snowflake."
Hammer: "Oh, was that the building classifier thingy Katorin was working on?"
Player: "Yeah, that one."
Hammer: "That must've taken a lot of work."
Player: "Yeah. Couldn't be prouder of my colleagues. We knocked it out of the park."
Player: "Not even a single hotfix we had to deploy. Pretty rare for my job."
Hammer: "Wow, uh, that must've been a relief."
Player: "It kept me on edge for a while."
Hammer: "Ahaha, I know that feeling a little too well."
Player: "... you do?"
Hammer: "It's a long story."
Player: "You gotta start telling me these long stories someday, uh..."
Player: "Sorry, I can't remember if you told me your name."

Hammer: "Oh! Uh..."
Player: "Calling you 'the hammer' seems a little on the nose."
Player: "I guess you still want to remain somewhat anonymous."
Hammer: "How about you call me 'Marteau' for now, at least until we get a little further into this relationship of ours?"
Player: "Marteau? What kind of name is that?"
Hammer: "It's the name of my character in a campaign for this tabletop game I've been playing with my friends for a few weeks now."
Player: "Umm, sure, *Marteau*..."
Marteau: "Look, my character's an inventor, alright?"
Player: "... what does your name have to do with that?"
Marteau: "It's, uh, French for hammer..."
Player: "You know what? I can get behind that. Seems very fitting for you."
Player: "I might call you Marty, then, on occasion. I'm not the best with French."
Marteau: "That's fine. My friends do during sessions, anyway."

Player: "Man, it's been a while I've been in a campaign. Been waiting for Katorin to DM again, and it's been taking a while."
Marteau: "Oh, Katorin's great! She's pretty creative."
Player: "You've had a campaign with her?"
Marteau: "Of course!"
Player: "... have we met before, and I'm just not aware of it?"
Marteau: "No, not at all."
Player: "Huh. I thought we might've ended up playing together."
Marteau: "Sorry. Maybe we will if she finishes doing all the prep work for the homebrew one she's been wanting to do for a while."
Player: "Yeah, maybe we will."

Marteau adjusts themselves, going into an almost laying position.

Marteau: "Ah, man, I could sleep on this thing..."
Player: "I sometimes do. I won't be surprised if you doze off."
Marteau: "Ah, I'll try not to! I have to still be awake for later."
Marteau: "I still want to swing by that pastry shop before they close."
Marteau: "Hmm, you know, I should probably get going."

Marteau gets up from the couch and puts their shoes back on. I walk over to them as they stand up.

Marteau: "Well, uh, thanks for the first date! I hope I didn't disappoint."
Player: "Nah, you're fine, Marty. You want to do this again next week?"

They come closer and brace for a hug. Their head rests on my shoulder.

Marteau: "I'd love to. And I'll promise to figure something out, so we can head to that café."
Player: "Sounds good to me."

We hold the hug for a few seconds before Marteau breaks away.

Marteau: "Well, off I go. See you later, [Player]."
Player: "See ya, Marty."

Marteau starts to walk out the door before I interrupt.

Player: "Oh, I wanted to say this the last time, but you ran off so quickly..."

Marteau turns around.

Marteau: "Hmm?"
Player: "I like the color of your shoes. It fits well with your personality."

They briefly look down at their shoes and look back at me.

Marteau: "Oh, thanks! Teal's my favorite color."

Marteau waves and closes the door. I lean back in the armchair and look out the window. They're... definitely interesting. I'll have to see how the next date goes.
