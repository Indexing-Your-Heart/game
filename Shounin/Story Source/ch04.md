Friday evening rolls around the corner as quickly as it did last week. I feel confident that we'll progress further than before, given last week's date. I smile as I make my way over to Le Papillon Pâtisserie, carrying a small bag of chocolate squares I got from Zimmerman's Sweets. Conveniently, it's located a block or two away from the workplace, so it's easy to grab something on the way back after work. I notice that the waterfront seems nearly empty for a Friday night as I walk up. Not a single person is in sight.

As soon as I get close to the pastry shop, I find Marty sitting on a bench with a book. They seem to be reading pretty intensely, ignoring their surroundings almost entirely. I carefully make my way over to the bench and take a seat next to them.

Player: "Hey, Marty."

Marty doesn't respond, completely entranced by the book. I lightly tap on their shoulder to get their attention. Marty looks up from the book.

Marty: "Oh, hey. When did you get here?"

(Choice)

- "I just sat down."
    - Marty: "Oh, good. I thought I'd end up finishing this chapter by the time you'd get here."
- "About a couple of minutes ago."
    - Marty: "Really? I must've not noticed you."
    - Marty: "Silly me, getting engrossed in this book!"
- "What do you mean? I've been here the entire time."
    - Marty remains silent, likely giving a smirk.
    - Marty: "Ha, ha, [Player]. How long have you really been on this bench for?"
    - Player: "You got me. I just sat down."
    - Marty: "I see."

Marty closes the book and opens their purse, ready to put the book inside. I glance at the cover. It reads 'After the Mirage'.

Player: "Is that the book you wanted to pick up from the library?"
Marty: "Yeah, I just went about thirty minutes ago."

I notice the bookmark sticking out halfway, lodged in the middle of the book.

Player: "You're halfway through already?"
Marty: "It's a real page-turner, [Player]! I thought I wasn't going to stop and totally miss you by mistake."

Marty puts the book into their purse.

Marty: "I'm surprised the library had the latest in the series."
Marty: "It usually takes them months to get the new book in after it start selling copies."
Marty: "The librarians know me all too well."
Player: "Haha, I bet they do."
Marty: "Say, [Player], I wanted to know if we could head to Kellihim Park."
Marty: "There's a spot I usually like sitting at."
Player: "Sure, why not."

The two of us get up from the bench and start walking down the road until we reach Narock Boulevard. As we continue walking down Narock Boulevard, Marty looks around and spots the dealership across the street.

Marty: "How long has that dealership been there, [Player]?"
Player: "For as long as I can remember. Why do you ask?"
Marty: "I don't think I've ever noticed it, really."
Player: "You seemed to know where it was two weeks ago."
Marty: "Well, yeah, but I've never seen it in person, [Player]."

Marty: "I wonder what kind of cars they sell."

- "Who knows, really?"
    - Marty: "Maybe they capitalize on extended car warranties."
    - Player: "They probably do."
- "Extended car warranties, probably."
    - Marty: "Right, the only business to get into nowadays."
    - Marty snickers.
- "Cars."
    - Marty: "Well, aren't you Captain Obvious?"
    - Marty shoves me and laughs a little.

I follow Marty to the spot in Kellihim Park where they wanted to take me. A bunch of trees surround the spot, allowing the sunlight to peek through the leaves. The lush, green grass takes in the sunlight and glows a little. Marty sits down next to a tree and pats to an open spot next to them. I follow and take a seat next to them, leaning against the tree.

Player: "Wow. How often do you come here?"
Marty: "Eh, about once a month. Maybe every two weeks."
Marty: "It just kind of depends on the occasion."
Player: "Well, you certainly have a knack for finding these sorts of places."
Marty: "I guess I know where to look when I need some space."

Marty sits up and unties their shoelaces.

Marty: "It feels like I've been walking forever today. I hope you don't mind."

I look at the trees as Marty takes off their shoes, placing them to the side. A few moments later, I hear something being zipped up. I turn and notice that their feet had been tucked away into a small stub, with a zipper going around the circumference of the dress.

Player: "Is that a new addition to the costume as well?"
Marty: "Oh, no, it's always been there. Just tucked away."
Player: "Huh. You really do think of everything when making these things."
Marty: "I thought about doing the same thing for the sleeves. I don't have enough fabric or zippers to do it, though."
Player: "I think you look fine with the sleeves intact."
Marty: "Well, thanks..."

Marty scoots closer to me and leans against my side.

Marty: "I hope this isn't too awkward for you."
Player: "Normally, if someone in a costume like that decides to lean up against me, I would be weirded out."
Player: "But you're an exception to the rule."
Marty: "Aww, I get special exemptions! How sweet of you."

The two of us laugh wholeheartedly.

Marty: "There is some meaning to me wearing this costume and not another, though."
Player: "Is this another long story?"
Marty: "Well, yeah, but we have the time here."
Marty: "But I'd like to know what's in your little bag there before getting started."
Marty: "You've piqued my interest."
Player: "Alright."

I pull out the box of chocolate square from the bag and put it on my lap. I hear Marty gasp lightly.

Marty: "Oh, you got the good stuff, didn't ya?"
Player: "Perhaps."

I open the box, pull out a chocolate square, and eat it. Marty points to the box.

Marty: "May I?"
Player: "Of course. I didn't buy the box to eat them myself."

Marty unzips the bottom of the helmet front, takes a chocolate square, and pops it in their mouth.

Marty: "Mm, you got the dark chocolate ones."
Player: "It's a variety, actually."
Marty: "Hmm, I see. Any particular one you like?"

I pick one of the chocolate squares with the darker tone. As soon as I hand it to them, they lean in and grab the square with their mouth. I watch as the square slides in like a slot-loading CD drive. Marty giggles in enjoyment.

Marty: "This one's good, too. I should stop, though."

Marty zips the hole back up and scoots closer to me as I put the box next to the bag. We stare at each other for a little while before they break the silence.

Marty: "God, I can't help but keep looking into your eyes, [Player]."
Player: "I wish I could say the same, but..."
Marty: "Yeah, I know... Soon, [Player], soon."
Marty: "This is gonna be a weird question to ask, but could I cuddle with you?"
Player: "Uh, sure..."

Marty scoots closer to me and lifts themselves up, propping their legs on top of mine. I move my arms and hug them.

Player: "So... about this hammer story..."
Marty: "Right… this is something that not a lot of people know about me."
Player: "I won't spread it."
Marty: "Ahaha, it's not a deadly secret, [Player]."

Marty adjusts themselves.

Marty: "I like to do some light coding on the side."
Player: "Really? I wasn't expecting that."
Player: "Guess that explains the whole binary thing last night, too."
Marty: "It's just more of a learning thing, really. I don't do a whole of it."
Player: "What kinds of things do you do?"
Marty: "Mostly web development with C#. And some mobile apps."
Player: "Huh, that's interesting. How does the hammer fit into..."

I pause for a moment and look at Marty, now in the optimal cuddling position. Suddenly, it clicks.

Player: "Ohh... I get it."
Player: "You're a hammer because of the Hexcode icon, aren't you?"

Marty giggles.

Marty: "Believe me, everyone will still be at the tip of the iceberg when they find out how nerdy I really am."
Player: "That's clever."
Marty: "My father made me an accompanying blanket."
Player: "That's adorable."
Marty: "Well, now you and I share the inside joke."
Player: "Do you get hot at all wearing this?"
Marty: "Warm? Sure. But not hot; it's pretty airy wearing this."

Marty leans their helmet against my shoulders.

Marty: "Hehe, you're nice and warm..."
Marty: "I'm sorry if this is awkward for you."
Player: "Awkward? Not really."
Marty: "I'm a cuddler. And a toe wiggler, too, apparently."
Marty: "My closest friends say that I wiggle them a lot more than others do."
Marty: "I'm sorry for the weird fact. I don't know why I thought of it."

I notice the zipper on their stub move up and down slightly.

Player: "Huh. I guess I didn't notice it."

Marty: "You probably think I'm weird, don't you?"

- "Aren't we all?"
    - Marty: "Hmm, you have a good point."
    - Marty: "Do you think I'm weirder?"
    - Player: "You're fine just the way you are."
- "I'm weirder than you."
    - Marty: "Really? I don't think so."
    - Player: "Agree to disagree."
- "I don't think you're weird at all."
    - Player: "You're fine just the way you are, Marty, even if you're hiding in a hammer costume."
    - Marty: "You're too kind, [Player]."

Marty adjusts themselves and looks me in the eye.

Marty: "I could totally kiss you right now."
Marty: "I don't know how well that would work, though. I've never done it before."
Player: "I guess we'll cross that bridge when that helmet comes off."
Marty: "You know, [Player], I had some doubts in my mind when I handed you that letter."
Marty: "That this wasn't gonna work out."
Player: "I'd say it's pretty successful so far."
Marty: "Well, [Player], the more I hang out with you like this, the more confident I feel that my doubts are wrong."
Marty: "Granted, there are still some things we need to explore for my sake, but..."
Marty: "I think I might be falling in love with you, [Player]."
Player: "Well, I could say the same myself. You are a rather charming individual."
Marty: "Charming? That's an unusual word to describe a hammer."
Player: "Well, last I checked, hammers don't have toes they can wiggle."

Marty giggles softly.

Marty: "You're funny, [Player]."

---

A few hours pass, and I open my eyes, realizing I had fallen asleep in the park. Marty's sound asleep on me, being completely still. I lightly tap on their shoulder, waking them up gradually.

Marty: "Ugh... did I fall asleep on you?"
Player: "Yeah, I think we ended up snoozing."
Marty: "Ah. You make a good substitute for a bed, in that case."

Marty swings their foot around to undo the zipper a little before bringing their legs behind them. I barely catch a glob of pink.

Marty: "I just realized I have stuff to do tomorrow. Some shopping and what-not."
Player: "Yeah, I promised Katorin I'd go with her to some local event tomorrow."
Marty: "Sounds like fun."
Player: "Debatable. You're more fun to be around, honestly."

Marty laughs while putting their shoes on.

Marty: "Well, I should get going now."
Player: "Same. Where do you want to meet up next week?"
Marty: "I'll text you by Monday on that. I'm kind of groggy right now and can't think straight."
Player: "Fair enough. Goodnight, Marty."
Marty: "Goodnight, [Player]."

We briefly hug for a moment before going our separate ways. As I walk through the park and make my way to the apartment, I think about what we talked about earlier. Marty seems confident in our relationship for the most part. I wonder what it is Marty wants to explore before they make the commitment. After tonight, I certainly wouldn't mind.
