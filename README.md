# Indexing Your Heart (Codename "Head Over Heels")

**Indexing Your Heart** is an upcoming A Witness-like puzzle game from _Created by
Marquis Kurt_ about a transfemme pansexual anthropomorphic coyote falling in love
with a highly-skilled artificial intelligence and machine learning engineer in New
Rollinsport. Explore Chelsea Roslynâ€™s inner world with puzzles that present many
ideas about her own thoughts and feelings, while following the story of her finding
the love of her life, Sam.

## Getting started: Build from source

**Required Tools**

- Xcode 14 or later
- macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
- Just (`brew install just`)
- Godot 4.0.x

**Optional Tools**

- Salmon 9 font family
- SwiftLint and SwiftFormat (used internally for code formatting)
- Xcode Command Line Tools

Start by cloning the repository using `gh repo clone` or `git clone --recursive`.
Then, run `just build-all-deps` to build the required dependencies for the internal
extensions that the main game uses.

From here, you can open the Shounin project in Godot or run `just edit-game` to open
Godot automatically.

> **Note**  
> Using `just edit-game` assumes that you have the Godot binary in your PATH.

### Editing Dependencies

If you need to edit any of the dependent libraries, you can run `just edit-deps` or
open the Indexing Your Heart.xcworkspace file. This will open Xcode with all the
Swift packages used to build the libraries that the Godot project utilizes.

### Exporting Requirements

Generally, you can export the Godot project like any other typical Godot project,
with the following caveats/requirements:

- **The dependent libraries currently only build for macOS and iOS.** They do not
  build for any other platform.
- **The JSON files in the data folder must be included.** Add `data/*.json` to the
  required paths to export in the Resources tab of each target you'd like to build
  for.

### Using Salmon 9 Fonts

By default, this project does _not_ include the Salmon 9 font family per its license
agreement. Instead, the default system font is loaded (see Godot's `SystemFont`).

If you have purchased the Salmon 9 font family and want to use those fonts in the
game, replace the following files with the corresponding family variants:

- **Monospace** (`Shounin/resources/salmon/s_mono_regular.ttf`): Salmon Mono 9
  Regular
- **Sans-serif** (`Shounin/resources/salmon/s_sans_regular.ttf`): Salmon Sans 9
  Regular
- **Sans-serif (Bold)** (`Shounin/resources/salmon/s_sans_bold.ttf`): Salmon Sans 9
  Bold
- **Serif** (`Shounin/resources/salmon/s_serif_regular.ttf`): Salmon Serif 9 Regular
- **Serif (Bold)** (`Shounin/resources/salmon/s_serif_bold.ttf`): Salmon Serif 9
  Bold

If you have not purchased the font and would like to do so, you can find the font on
Phildjii's page on Itch.io at https://phildjii.itch.io/salmon-family.

### Using the utilities package (Marteau)

The Marteau package (`marteau`) includes utilities for handling helper functions
such as:

- Updating build configurations
- Converting Markdown documents to Jenson timelines

More information on how to install and use Marteau can be found on the source code
repository for Marteau at https://github.com/Indexing-Your-Heart/marteau.
