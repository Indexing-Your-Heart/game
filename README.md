# Indexing Your Heart (Codename "Head Over Heels")

**Indexing Your Heart** is an upcoming A Witness-like puzzle game from _Created by
Marquis Kurt_ about a transfemme pansexual anthropomorphic coyote falling in love
with a highly-skilled artificial intelligence and machine learning engineer in New
Rollinsport. Explore Chelsea Roslynâ€™s inner world with puzzles that present many
ideas about her own thoughts and feelings, while following the story of her finding
the love of her life, Sam.

> **Warning**  
> This branch pertains to a rewrite of the game using the Godot Engine v4, and it
> is still in its infancy. Documentation may be incomplete as the rewrite
> progresses. Visit the `prototype` branch to view the current source code available
> for the current version on TestFlight.

> **Warning**  
> This project is still in its infancy, so some details and mechanics may not work
> as intended. If you'd like to support the project,
> [consider supporting the developers on Ko-fi][kofi].

## Getting started: Build from source

**Required Tools**

- Xcode 14 or later
- macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
- Just (`brew install just`)
- Godot 4.0.x

**Optional Tools**

- Salmon 9 font family
- SwiftLint and SwiftFormat (used internally for code formatting)
- Xcode Command Line Tools

Start by cloning the repository using `gh repo clone` or `git clone --recursive`.
Then, run `just build-swift-godot` and `just build-all-deps` to build the required
dependencies for the internal extensions that the main game uses.

From here, you can open the Shounin project in Godot through the project manager, or
you can invoke `just edit-game` to open the project directly in the editor.

To run the game as-is, call `just dry-run`. The game will launch as if it were built
and distributed.

> **Note**  
> Using `just edit-game` assumes that the `gdengine` variable in the Justfile is
> pointing to the Godot binary in your `PATH`. Edit this variable to match the path
> of your Godot binary if this doesn't match, or update `PATH` to include the Godot
> binary.

### Editing Dependencies

If you need to edit any of the dependent libraries, you can run `just edit-deps` or
open the Indexing Your Heart.xcworkspace file. This will open Xcode with all the
Swift packages used to build the libraries that the Godot project utilizes.

To rebuild all dependencies after making adjustments, run `just build-all-deps`.
The correct build flags will be applied to ensure binaries for macOS and iOS are
available. Likewise, you can call either `just build-dep` or run `.build-libs.sh` to
build a given dependency.

### Exporting Requirements

Generally, you can export the Godot project like any other typical Godot project,
with the following caveats/requirements:

- **The dependent libraries currently only build for macOS and iOS.** They do not
  build for any other platform.
- **The JSON files in the data folder must be included.** Add `data/*.json` to the
  required paths to export in the Resources tab of each target you'd like to build
  for.

### Using Salmon 9 Fonts

By default, this project does _not_ include the Salmon 9 font family per its license
agreement. Instead, the default system font is loaded (see Godot's `SystemFont`).

If you have purchased the Salmon 9 font family and want to use those fonts in the
game, replace the following files with the corresponding family variants:

- **Monospace** (`Shounin/resources/gui/salmon/s_mono_regular.ttf`): Salmon Mono 9
  Regular
- **Sans-serif** (`Shounin/resources/gui/salmon/s_sans_regular.ttf`): Salmon Sans 9
  Regular
- **Sans-serif (Bold)** (`Shounin/resources/gui/salmon/s_sans_bold.ttf`): Salmon
  Sans 9 Bold
- **Serif** (`Shounin/resources/gui/salmon/s_serif_regular.ttf`): Salmon Serif 9
  Regular
- **Serif (Bold)** (`Shounin/resources/gui/salmon/s_serif_bold.ttf`): Salmon Serif 9
  Bold

If you have not purchased the font and would like to do so, you can find the font on
Phildjii's page on Itch.io at https://phildjii.itch.io/salmon-family.

### Using the utilities package (Marteau)

The Marteau package (`marteau`) includes utilities for handling helper functions
such as:

- Updating build configurations
- Converting Markdown documents to Jenson timelines

### Just Commands

The following is the list of commands available from Just. You can also view this
list by invoking `just -l`.

```
Available recipes:
    build-all-deps           # Build all dependencies
    build-dep LIB_FLAGS +DEPENDENCIES # Build a specified set of dependencies with some flags
    build-swift-godot        # Builds the SwiftGodot xcframework.
    clean-all-deps           # Cleans all dependencies
    clean-dep +DEPENDENCIES  # Cleans a specified set of dependencies
    dry-run                  # Dry run the game locally
    edit-build-lib           # Edits the script that builds libraries
    edit-deps                # Edits dependencies in Xcode
    edit-game                # Open Godot editor
    edit-just                # Edits this Justfile
    fetch-remote-deps        # Fetches remote dependencies from Git submodules
    format-all-deps          # Formats source files in all dependencies
    format-dep +DEPENDENCIES # Formats the source files in a specified set of dependencies
    lint                     # Runs SwiftLint on library code
    test-all-deps            # Test all dependencies
    test-dep +DEPENDENCIES   # Test a specified set of dependencies

```
